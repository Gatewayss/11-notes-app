# Note Taking App

This is a simple note-taking application that allows users to create and save notes. When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they will be presented with a page that has two columns. The left-hand column will display a list of existing notes, and the right-hand column will have empty fields for entering a new note title and text. Creating a new note is easy by clicking on the plus icon to the right side. To save a note you click the save icon to the left of the notes icon.  The left hand column displays the notes made previously.
